# connectiq-pulse
This is an application for Garmin smart watches that renders realtime heart-rate sensor data on screen. The on-screen UI includes a centered heart which pulses at the same rate as the heart. Thus, one can "see"  their heart rate on the watch face. The UI also includes an outside arc indicating the heart-rate zone in addition to the textual representation of the zone and Maximum Heart Rate (%) value.
